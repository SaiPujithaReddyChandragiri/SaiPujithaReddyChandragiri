👋 Hi, I’m Sai Pujitha Reddy Chandragiri!

  * 🔭 I’m currently working on:
    
      Building scalable cloud solutions and sharpening my expertise in AWS services, DevOps practices, and automation frameworks. My latest project involves enhancing observability for cloud-native applications using the Elastic Stack.
      
  * 🌱 I’m currently learning:
    
  Advanced AWS architectures and DevOps tools like Puppet, Chef, and Jenkins to further optimize automation and infrastructure management.

  * 💁🏼 worked on :
  1. Automated Cloud Migration Toolkit

    Overview:
    Led the development of a phased cloud migration approach to streamline on-premises-to-cloud transitions. This project resulted in a 40% reduction in migration time by automating tasks and ensuring seamless execution.
    
    How I Did It:
    	•	Assessment & Planning: Developed a migration planner using Python to analyze existing infrastructure. This tool automatically generated migration plans by evaluating workloads and dependencies.
    	•	Implementation: Used Terraform and AWS SDKs to define Infrastructure as Code (IaC), ensuring consistent and replicable deployments. CI/CD pipelines were implemented using Jenkins for automated integration and deployment.
    	•	Execution: Finalized the migrations by integrating monitoring tools to validate data integrity, operational security, and performance post-migration. Leveraged AWS services like CloudFormation and CloudWatch to track resources and performance metrics.
 2. Cloud-Based Attendance Tracking System

        Overview:
        Built a serverless attendance system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB, improving operational efficiency by 25%. This project demonstrated my ability to use cloud-native technologies to automate processes and reduce overhead.
        
        How I Did It:
        	•	Designed the architecture with a serverless approach to minimize costs and ensure scalability.
        	•	Created RESTful APIs with AWS API Gateway to handle attendance submissions and validations in real time.
        	•	Automated data ingestion and validation processes by integrating AWS Lambda functions with S3 storage and DynamoDB for secure and efficient data storage.
        	•	Implemented real-time monitoring using AWS CloudWatch, ensuring quick identification and resolution of issues.
 3. EduConnect: Dynamic Assignment Management Platform

        Overview:
        Designed and deployed a platform for assignment submissions using MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. This project supported over 500+ users and enhanced engagement by 20% with real-time notifications.
        
        How I Did It:
        	•	Developed a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive user experience.
        	•	Created a robust back-end with PHP to handle user authentication, file uploads, and dynamic notifications.
        	•	Used MySQL to store and retrieve assignment data efficiently, ensuring low-latency access for users.
        	•	Deployed the application on cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability and reliability under heavy usage.
 4. AWS APAC Solutions Architecture Virtual Experience

        Overview:
        Designed a scalable hosting architecture based on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for a client experiencing rapid growth and slow response times.
        
        How I Did It:
        	•	Architected a solution using Elastic Beanstalk, enabling automated environment scaling and improved application performance.
        	•	Provided cost analysis and plain-language explanations to the client, ensuring they understood the benefits and pricing structure of the solution.
        	•	Demonstrated the solution’s performance improvements through simulated tests, showcasing a clear ROI.
